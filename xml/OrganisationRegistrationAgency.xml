                <narrative>The Afghan Central Business Registry is a service which allows a single place to register a business in Afghanistan. All companies, groups and individuals are required to register at the ACBR, where they receive confirmation of their registration, become published in the ACBR Gazette and receive the Tax Identification Number. 

&quot;The new Central Registry is a one stop shop to register your business. It brings together all of the functions previously done by the commercial courts, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance.&quot; [1]

&quot;ACBR exists to provide services to businesses in Afghanistan intending to register their names and protect their intellectual property rights.&quot; [2]

&quot;All corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships doing Trade are required to register with ACBR, which facilitates the registration process, including assistance for completing the application form, paying fees, publishing key business information in the Official Gazette and reporting specification of businesses to the Revenue Department of MoF. Registration is required only one time unless a business makes major changes (i.e., change in ownership, executive management, or location or if the initial capital increases or decreases).

Businesses are referred to ACBR from either the Trader License office located in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, from AISA, or from any other license departments after they acquire a business license.&quot; [3]

&quot;ABN registration details become part of the Australian Business Register (ABR)&quot;

Each ABN should equate to a single 'business structure', although that structure may be used to carry out a range of business activities.  A range of kinds of entity are issued ABNs, including individuals, corporations, partnerships, unincorporated associations, trusts and superannuation funds. Entities must be carrying on a business in or connection to Australia to receive an ABN.</narrative>

                <narrative>All NGOs wishing to carry out programmes in Bangladesh must gain permission from the Bangladesh NGO Affairs Bureau. The Bureau keeps a list of NGOs, monitors funding and ensures the accountability of NGO projects.

&quot;Its prime objective is to provide one-stop service to the NGOs operating with foreign assistance and registered under the Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Ordinance, 1978. In addition, it facilitates the activities of the NGOs in the country, and ensures their accountability to the state and thereby to the people of the country&quot; [1]

&quot;Bureau approves the project proposals submitted by NGOs&quot; [2]

&quot;NGOs much certify in the project proposal that they receive foreign donation or contribution from legal sources.&quot; [3]

&quot;Bureau has the responsibility to make sure that money being channelized by NGOs is from legal sources. Bureau also realizes government revenue-both tax (income tax, VAT etc) and non-tax (registration fee). Bureau always coordinates with NGOs, line ministries, different state agencies and development partners in discharging its duty as the regulatory authority. Here the spirit is to facilitate the NGO activities, not to regulate them&quot; [4]

                <narrative>Companies in Canada register with their provincial authority, e.g. British Columbia, and then they register with the Canadian Revenue Agency in order to pay corporate income tax and receive a Business Number.

The code CA-CRA_ACR is used for Canadian Business Numbers. 

Non-profits and other kinds of legal entities may also have a Canadian Business Number. 

The business number is sometimes reported with a Program Account code (e.g. RP0001 to indicate a payroll program account, leading a number such as 123456789RP0001). In constructing an organisation identifier, only the first nine digits should be used. 

Companies can be searched by using the Business Number, as assigned by the CRA, on this incomplete registry hosted by the Canadian govt - https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html?locale=en_CA

## More detail:

Not all companies need a Canadian Business Number. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/bn-ne/wrks-eng.html

Not all charities need to register with the Canadian Revenue Agency. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/rgstrtn/mnd-eng.html

Not all non-profit organisations must register to become a charity. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/dnrs/rgltn/dffrnc-rc-np-eng.html

It allows also to switch directly to www applications of the state administration bodies provided that such applications already exist.&quot; [1]

&quot;It is not possible to make a registration in the Information System ARES directly. It is necessary to proceed in accordance with applicable laws and to make a registration at the registration points of the public administration authorities. Likewise, data changes or termination of the registration must be reported to the institution that maintains the source registry. List of source registers and responsible institutions is presented in the tab REGISTRATION AUTHORITIES.&quot; [2]

                <narrative>In France, companies register through a number of institutions, predominantly the local centres de formalités des entreprises, but all companies must eventually be registered with the Trade and Companies Register. Once registered, companies receive a SIREN or SIRET number, which is a unique business identifier.

This information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.

A note on identifiers: 

A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. 

The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.

&quot;A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business&quot; [1]

&quot;The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.

The 14-digit number consists of three parts:

- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,
- second, the NIC (French: Numéro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,
- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.

OC have thus added their own identifier number based on each registry type. Further details available here - qa_public/register_problems/guernsey

&quot;All Guernsey companies must file an Annual Validation submission with the Registry during January 2017 (unless incorporated in December 2016). Submissions received after 31 January 2017 will be subject to a £100 late filing fee.&quot; [1]

This information is accessible in data.gov.in

&quot;The Registrar of Companies (ROC) is an office under the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs that deals with administration of the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act, 2013. There are currently 22 Registrars of Companies (ROC) operating from offices in all major states of India. Some states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, have two ROCs each. Section 609 of the Companies Act, 1956 tasks the ROCs with the primary duty of registering companies and LLPs floated in the respective states and the union territories under their administration.

The Registrar of Company takes care of company registration (also known as incorporation) in India, completes reporting and regulation of companies and their directors and shareholders, and also oversees government reporting of various matters including the annual filling of various documents.&quot; [1]

                <narrative>All NGOs operating in Malawi must register with the NGO Board of Malawi. All NPOs must also register with the Registrar General. There is a pdf file with a list of registered NGOs, but they do not have registration numbers. New database is planned.

&quot;In line with Section 20 of the NGO Act, every organization that wishes to operate or is operating in Malawi as an NGO must register with the NGO Board of Malawi. The Board is a regulatory Body for NGOs in Malawi and failure to register with it means the NGO will be operating illegally.&quot; [1]

&quot;We are currently improving our directory which will not only show a list of registered NGOs when this process is completed, but will also provide an overview of each registered NGO, contacts, and will be searchable by sector and/or location (District).&quot; [2]

&quot;The Registrar General is responsible for the registration and the administration non-profit entities under the Trustees Incorporation Act Cap. 5:03. &quot; [3]

                <narrative>All companies and entities (including most NGOs) in the Netherlands must enrol with the Commercial Register, which is hosted by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. Each entity receives a Chamber of Commerce number upon registration, which is the appropriate identifier Dutch companies and NPOs.

Basic company information is available for free, detailed info can be downloaded for a fee.

&quot;All companies and entities in the Netherlands must enroll in the Commercial Register. By law, you have a business if you provide common goods or services to others with the intent to make a profit.&quot; [1] 

&quot;Recipient companies can consult www.kvk.nl/waadi to check if agencies are registered on the Chamber of Commerce website. They can do this simply by entering their Chamber or Commerce number, which is assigned to all companies and legal entities upon registration in the Business Register.&quot; [2] 

&quot;The major forms of Dutch non-profit organization are the associations, the foundations and the churches... Associations registered in The Netherlands are unions between two or more individuals, physical persons or corporate bodies that pursue certain goals stated in the Articles of Association and that cannot divide profit among its members... There are two types of associations that can be set up in the Netherlands: with complete authority under the law (in this case the articles of associations are drawn by a civil notary and it’s mandatory in this case that the association is registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce trade register) and with limited authority under the law (when the articles are not drawn up by a notary and the registration is not mandatory).&quot; [3]

&quot;Any person intending to establish an agency, and any person

of the prescribed fee, make an application to the Registration

                <narrative>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns companies an Employer Identification Number (EIN) upon application. However, not all corporate entities are required to have an EIN. Corporate registration is done at the state level. There is no national database for searching unique identifiers. 

Users should refer to individual state databases in order to find identifiers. Alternatively, organisations often have their EIN on a public webpage, and these can be found by using a search engine. For example, search for 'American Red Cross EIN' returns a page with their EIN.

&quot;An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. &quot; [1]

&quot;An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID.&quot; [2]

&quot;In the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time.

Across those states performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates.&quot; [3]

&quot;The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN.

                <narrative>XI-IATI is a list of organisation identifiers that is maintained by the IATI Secretariat. Any publisher may apply to the IATI Technical Team for an identifier to be generated.

&quot;If a bona fide organisation is not registered with any recognised or appropriate registration agency (http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/) they should contact the IATI Technical Team who will exceptionally allocate an organisation identifier using the XI-IATI prefix.

While some of these identifiers have been derived from DAC codes, this ‘meaning’ is not carried forward. i.e. IATI generated identifiers have no intrinsic meaning.

For general guidance about constructing Organisation Identifiers, please see http://iatistandard.org/organisation-identifiers/&quot; [1]

                <narrative>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) has created a list of organisations whom are involved in the transfer of financial flows within the work of the OECD DAC. A list of all the Donors, Agencies and Recipients can be downloaded from the OECD website. This list is updated every three years.

See Donor, Agency and Delivery Channel codes.

&quot;The overarching objective of the DAC for 2011-2015  is to promote development co-operation and other policies so as to contribute to sustainable development, including pro-poor economic growth, poverty reduction, improvement of living standards in developing countries, and to a future in which no country will depend on aid.&quot; [1]

&quot;The DAC revises the list every three years. Countries that have exceeded the high-income threshold for three consecutive years at the time of the review are removed.&quot; [2]

The database can be searched for free.

Users should note that they should not include &quot;NPO&quot; to the end of the identifier.

&quot;The Nonprofit Organisations Directorate was established in terms of the Nonprofit Organisations Act 71 of 1997 to essentially administer the Register of Nonprofit Organisations in South Africa.  

The Register of Nonprofit Organisations (NPOs) is a voluntary registration facility that enhances the credibility of the registered NPO as it reports to a public office. The NPO Directorate, as a public office, holds information about registered NPOs for the public to access. &quot; [1]
